## Connecting Salto to Confluence

Salto supports authenticating with Atlassian Confluence using a user email and password:

- Connect to Confluence with the command 'salto account add confluence' or 'salto account login confluence'.
- You will be asked to provide the Atlassian subdomain (e.g. https://< subdomain >.atlassian.net/), the user email, and password.
